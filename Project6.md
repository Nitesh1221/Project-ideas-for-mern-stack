### **6. E-Commerce Product Listing**

#### **Objective**  
Build a simplified e-commerce platform to showcase products, filter them based on categories, sort by price or rating, and add to a cart. This project introduces you to UI/UX best practices, state management, and basic e-commerce functionality.

---

### **Technologies and Topics**

1. **Frontend**:  
   - **React.js**: For building the user interface.  
   - **React Router**: For navigation between pages (Home, Product Details, Cart).  
   - **CSS/TailwindCSS**: For responsive styling.  
   - **Context API** or **Redux**: For state management (cart and filters).  

2. **Backend (Optional)**:  
   - **JSON Server**: For product data and cart management.  
   - **Firebase Firestore**: For a lightweight backend with real-time updates.

3. **Free Mock APIs**:  
   - **Fakestore API**: Free product data for testing.

### **Features to Include**

1. **Home Page**:  
   - Display all products in a grid layout with a thumbnail, name, price, and rating.  

2. **Filter and Sort**:  
   - Filter products by categories (e.g., electronics, clothing).  
   - Sort by price (low to high or high to low) or rating.  

3. **Product Details**:  
   - Display detailed product information on a separate page.  

4. **Add to Cart**:  
   - Allow users to add products to a cart and view the cart items.  

5. **Responsive Design**:  
   - Ensure the platform works on both desktop and mobile.  

6. **Optional Features**:  
   - Search bar for finding products.  
   - Pagination or infinite scroll for product lists.  
   - Checkout page for mock purchases.

### **Steps to Build**

#### **Phase 1: Plan**  
1. Define key pages:  
   - **Home**: Displays all products with filtering and sorting options.  
   - **Product Details**: Displays detailed info for a single product.  
   - **Cart**: Shows added products with a total price.  

2. Decide the product data structure.  

Example Product JSON:  
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Wireless Headphones",
    "price": 2999,
    "category": "Electronics",
    "rating": 4.5,
    "image": "https://example.com/headphones.jpg",
    "description": "High-quality wireless headphones with noise cancellation."
  }
]
```

#### **Phase 2: Development**

1. **Setup React Project**:  
   - Use `npx create-react-app ecommerce-platform`.  

2. **Add Routing with React Router**:  
   - Install React Router:  
     ```bash
     npm install react-router-dom
     ```  
   - Define routes for Home, Product Details, and Cart.  

Example Router Setup:  
```javascript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/product/:id" element={<ProductDetails />} />
        <Route path="/cart" element={<Cart />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

3. **Build Components**:  
   - `Home`: Displays the product list with filtering and sorting options.  
   - `ProductCard`: A reusable component for each product.  
   - `ProductDetails`: Displays details of a single product.  
   - `Cart`: Shows all added products with total price and quantity controls.  

4. **State Management**:  
   - Use `useContext` or `useReducer` for cart and filters.  
   - Example cart state:  
     ```javascript
     const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);
     
     const addToCart = (product) => {
       setCart([...cart, product]);
     };
     ```

5. **Filtering and Sorting**:  
   - Add a dropdown for sorting and checkboxes for category filtering.  
   - Use state to store the selected filters and apply them to the product list.

6. **Fetch Product Data**:  
   - Use the Fakestore API or mock product data.  
   - Fetch data with `useEffect`:  
     ```javascript
     useEffect(() => {
       fetch("https://fakestoreapi.com/products")
         .then((res) => res.json())
         .then((data) => setProducts(data));
     }, []);
     ```

7. **Optional Backend**:  
   - Use JSON Server or Firebase Firestore to store product and cart data.  

---

#### **Phase 3: Testing and Deployment**

1. Test for:  
   - Proper filtering and sorting functionality.  
   - Correct routing for product details and cart.  
   - Responsiveness on different devices.  

2. Deploy the app to **Netlify** or **Vercel**.  
3. Push the project to GitHub and showcase it in your portfolio.
