### **4. Expense Tracker**

#### **Objective**  
Develop a web application to track personal or household expenses. Users can add expenses, categorize them, view a summary, and optionally set budgets. This project emphasizes form handling, data visualization, and basic financial management logic.

---

### **Technologies and Topics**  

1. **Frontend**:  
   - **React.js**: For UI and state management.  
   - **Chart.js** or **Recharts**: For visualizing expenses.  
   - **CSS/TailwindCSS**: For styling and responsive design.

2. **Backend (Optional)**:  
   - **Firebase Firestore**: For storing expenses and user budgets.  
   - **JSON Server**: A lightweight backend for mock data storage.

3. **Additional Tools**:  
   - **Local Storage**: Store data locally if a backend isn't used.  
   - **React Hooks**: Use `useState` and `useEffect` extensively.

### **Features to Include**  

1. **Add Expense**  
   - Allow users to add expenses with fields like:  
     - Name  
     - Amount  
     - Category (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment)  
     - Date  

2. **View Expense List**  
   - Display a list of expenses, optionally with sorting and filtering.  

3. **Expense Summary**  
   - Show total expenses by category or over a specific period.  

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Use a pie chart or bar chart to display category-wise spending.  

5. **Budget Setting (Optional)**  
   - Allow users to set a monthly budget and display progress.  

6. **Responsive Design**  
   - Ensure compatibility with mobile and desktop.

### **Steps to Build**

#### **Phase 1: Plan**  
1. Decide on the features to include (start with basic expense tracking).  
2. Sketch a rough UI (e.g., a form to add expenses, a list to display them, and a chart for visualization).  
3. Prepare a JSON structure for storing expenses.

Example JSON:  
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Groceries",
    "amount": 2000,
    "category": "Food",
    "date": "2025-01-20"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Movie Ticket",
    "amount": 500,
    "category": "Entertainment",
    "date": "2025-01-21"
  }
]
```

#### **Phase 2: Development**

1. **Setup React Project**:  
   - Initialize a React project with `npx create-react-app expense-tracker`.  

2. **Build Components**:  
   - `AddExpense`: A form to input expense details.  
   - `ExpenseList`: Displays all expenses in a tabular format.  
   - `ExpenseSummary`: Shows total spending and summary by category.  
   - `Chart`: Displays data visually (use **Chart.js** or **Recharts**).  

3. **State Management**:  
   - Use `useState` to manage expenses as an array.  
   - Use `useEffect` to fetch data from local storage or a backend.

Example:  
```javascript
const [expenses, setExpenses] = useState([]);

const addExpense = (expense) => {
  setExpenses([...expenses, expense]);
};
```

4. **CRUD Operations**:  
   - **Add**: Push new expense data to the `expenses` array.  
   - **Delete**: Allow users to remove an expense from the list.  
   - **Edit (Optional)**: Let users update expense details.

5. **Charts and Visualization**:  
   - Install **Chart.js** or **Recharts**:  
     ```bash
     npm install chart.js
     ```  
   - Example Pie Chart Setup:  
     ```javascript
     <Pie
       data={{
         labels: categories,
         datasets: [
           {
             data: categoryTotals,
             backgroundColor: ["#FF6384", "#36A2EB", "#FFCE56"],
           },
         ],
       }}
     />
     ```

6. **Optional Backend**:  
   - Use Firebase or JSON Server to persist expense data.

---

#### **Phase 3: Testing and Deployment**  

1. Test the app for:  
   - Input validation (e.g., positive amounts, valid dates).  
   - Responsive design on various devices.  

2. Deploy the app to **Netlify** or **Vercel**.  
3. Push the project to GitHub.
