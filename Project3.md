### **3. Quiz Application**

#### **Objective**  
Build a quiz application where users can answer questions, receive scores, and get feedback. This project will help you learn about dynamic rendering, data handling, and state management. It can be extended with a leaderboard or authentication for user profiles.

### **Technologies and Topics**  

1. **Frontend**:  
   - **React.js**: For building and managing the UI.  
   - **JavaScript**: For application logic.  
   - **CSS/TailwindCSS**: For styling and layout.  

2. **Backend (Optional)**:  
   - **Firebase Firestore**: To store quiz questions and user scores.  
   - **JSON Server**: For a mock backend.  

3. **Version Control and Hosting**:  
   - **Git/GitHub**: For version control.  
   - **Netlify** or **Vercel**: For free hosting.

### **Features to Include**  

1. **Quiz Questions**:  
   - Display multiple-choice questions.  
   - Show one question at a time with a "Next" button.  

2. **Score Tracking**:  
   - Track the user's score based on correct answers.  

3. **Timer (Optional)**:  
   - Add a countdown timer for each question.  

4. **Quiz Results**:  
   - Display the final score with feedback (e.g., "Good job!" or "Keep practicing!").  

5. **Question Bank**:  
   - Store a set of questions in JSON format or fetch them from a backend.

6. **Responsive Design**:  
   - Ensure the app works on mobile and desktop.  

7. **Optional Features**:  
   - A leaderboard showing top scorers.  
   - User authentication (login/signup).

### **Steps to Build**

#### **Phase 1: Plan**  
1. Design the app layout (e.g., welcome screen, question display, results screen).  
2. Prepare a JSON file for quiz questions (example below).  
3. Decide whether to use local storage, JSON Server, or Firebase.

Example JSON for Questions:  
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "options": ["Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid", "Rome"],
    "answer": "Paris"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "question": "Which programming language is used for web development?",
    "options": ["Python", "JavaScript", "C++", "Ruby"],
    "answer": "JavaScript"
  }
]
```

---

#### **Phase 2: Develop**  
1. **Setup React Project**:  
   - Use `npx create-react-app quiz-app` to set up the project.  

2. **Build Components**:  
   - `Quiz`: Main component managing the quiz.  
   - `QuestionCard`: Displays the question and options.  
   - `Results`: Displays the final score and feedback.

3. **State Management**:  
   - Use React's `useState` to track the current question, selected answers, and score.  
   - Use `useEffect` to fetch questions if using a backend.

4. **Quiz Logic**:  
   - On selecting an answer, compare it with the correct one and update the score.  
   - Move to the next question until the quiz ends.  

Example Logic for Handling Answers:  
```javascript
const handleAnswer = (selectedOption) => {
  if (selectedOption === questions[currentQuestion].answer) {
    setScore(score + 1);
  }
  setCurrentQuestion(currentQuestion + 1);
};
```

5. **Optional Backend**:  
   - **JSON Server**: Store questions in a `db.json` file and fetch them.  
   - **Firebase**: Set up Firestore for storing questions and scores.  

---

#### **Phase 3: Testing and Deployment**  
1. Test the app for edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs or out-of-bound indexes).  
2. Ensure responsiveness using tools like Chrome DevTools.  
3. Deploy the app to **Netlify** or **Vercel**.  
4. Share the GitHub repository and hosted link in your portfolio.
