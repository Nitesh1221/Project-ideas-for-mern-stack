### **7. Online Examination System**

#### **Objective**  
Develop an online examination platform where students can take tests, view their scores, and see detailed feedback for their answers. This project introduces features like user authentication, dynamic question generation, timer functionality, and result processing.

---

### **Technologies and Topics**

1. **Frontend**:  
   - **React.js**: For building the user interface.  
   - **React Router**: For navigation between pages (Home, Test, Result).  
   - **TailwindCSS** or **CSS**: For responsive design and styling.

2. **Backend**:  
   - **Node.js** and **Express.js**: For creating APIs.  
   - **MongoDB**: For storing user data, questions, and results.  

3. **Authentication**:  
   - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication.  
   - **Bcrypt.js**: For password hashing.

4. **Timer Management**:  
   - Use JavaScript's `setInterval` or libraries like **Moment.js**.  

5. **Version Control and Hosting**:  
   - **Git/GitHub**: For version control.  
   - **Netlify** (Frontend) and **Render** (Backend): For free hosting.

### **Features to Include**

1. **User Authentication**:  
   - Register and login with username and password.  

2. **Question Bank**:  
   - Store questions in the database categorized by topic and difficulty level.  

3. **Test Interface**:  
   - Display questions with options in a timed test format.  
   - Allow navigation between questions.  

4. **Results Page**:  
   - Show the userâ€™s score and detailed feedback (e.g., correct answers, time spent per question).  

5. **Admin Panel (Optional)**:  
   - Allow admins to upload and manage questions.  

6. **Responsive Design**:  
   - Ensure the platform works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### **Steps to Build**

#### **Phase 1: Plan**  
1. Define key components and pages:  
   - **Home**: Landing page with login and register options.  
   - **Dashboard**: Displays available tests.  
   - **Test Interface**: Displays questions and timer.  
   - **Results**: Displays the test score and feedback.  

2. Design the data models:  

**User Model**:  
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "student1",
  "password": "hashed_password"
}
```

**Question Model**:  
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "question": "What is React?",
  "options": ["Library", "Framework", "Language", "None of these"],
  "answer": "Library",
  "category": "Web Development",
  "difficulty": "Easy"
}
```

**Result Model**:  
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "userId": 1,
  "score": 8,
  "totalQuestions": 10,
  "timeTaken": "12:45"
}
```

#### **Phase 2: Development**

1. **Setup Frontend (React)**:  
   - Use `npx create-react-app online-exam-system`.  

2. **Add Routing with React Router**:  
   - Install React Router:  
     ```bash
     npm install react-router-dom
     ```  
   - Define routes for Home, Dashboard, Test Interface, and Results.  

3. **Build Components**:  
   - **Login/Signup**: Form to authenticate users using backend APIs.  
   - **Dashboard**: Displays tests and allows users to start a test.  
   - **Test Interface**:  
     - Fetch questions from the backend API.  
     - Implement a timer using `setInterval`.  
     - Store answers in local state and submit them at the end.  
   - **Results**: Fetch and display scores and feedback.  

4. **Setup Backend (Node.js + Express)**:  
   - Create APIs for:  
     - **User Authentication** (register/login).  
     - **Fetching Questions**.  
     - **Submitting Answers and Calculating Results**.  

5. **Database (MongoDB)**:  
   - Use MongoDB to store user information, questions, and test results.  
   - Use MongoDB Atlas for free hosting.  

6. **Authentication with JWT**:  
   - Generate JWT tokens upon login and validate them for secured endpoints.  

7. **Timer Implementation**:  
   - Add a countdown timer to the test interface.  
   - End the test automatically when time runs out.  

---

#### **Phase 3: Testing and Deployment**

1. **Testing**:  
   - Validate user authentication.  
   - Test navigation and time-based functionality in the test interface.  
   - Check result calculation accuracy.  

2. **Deployment**:  
   - Host the **frontend** on Netlify.  
   - Host the **backend** on Render or Railway.
